## Plugins

Canopus is built to be highly extensible through its plugin system. By adding or modifying plugins, users can customize Canopus to meet their specific needs.

### Pre-installed Plugins

The following plugins are included with Canopus out-of-the-box:

- **voice_auth.py**: Handles secure voice-based authentication.
- **object_detection.py**: Utilizes AI models to detect objects from input sources.
- **sos_command.py**: Sends urgent notifications or executes critical commands.
- **code_generation.py**: Assists with generating code snippets based on user input.
- **information_retrieval.py**: Retrieves information from web or local repositories.
- **spotify_service.py**: Integrates with Spotify for music control via voice commands.
- **chat.py**: Provides a simple chatbot interaction service.
- **utils.py**: Contains utility functions to support the plugins.

### Additional Plugins

More plugins can be added through our official [plugin repository](https://canopus-plugins.com). Users can browse, download, and install plugins to extend Canopus' functionality based on their specific needs.

### Creating a Custom Plugin

1. Navigate to the `plugins/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd plugins
   ```

2. Create a new plugin, for example `my_custom_plugin.py`, and define your custom logic:
   ```python
   def execute_command(args):
       # Custom logic here
       print("Executing custom command")
   ```

3. Register your plugin within the Canopus framework by adding it to the `config/config.py` file.
