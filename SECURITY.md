## Security Best Practices

To maintain the security of the Canopus project, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Use Strong Authentication**:
   - Enable voice authentication securely with the provided `voice_auth.py` plugin. Regularly update your voice authentication model to prevent unauthorized access.

2. **Install Plugins from Trusted Sources**:
   - Only install plugins from the official [Canopus Plugin Repository](https://github.com/Canopus-Development/Canopus-Plugins). Be cautious when using third-party plugins, as they may introduce security vulnerabilities.
   - When developing custom plugins, follow secure coding practices and ensure you validate and sanitize all input.

3. **Data Privacy**:
   - Canopus does not collect or store sensitive data by default. However, be mindful of the data processed by plugins. Ensure that personal data is handled responsibly and in compliance with applicable privacy laws.

4. **Network Security**:
   - When using Canopus in a networked environment (e.g., interacting with web services, APIs), ensure you use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to protect data in transit.

5. **Regular Updates**:
   - Keep your Canopus installation up to date. Regularly check for updates on the official GitHub repository to ensure you have the latest security patches and feature improvements.

For developers creating custom plugins, please follow these security guidelines:

- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks or other vulnerabilities.
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information through error messages.

- **Security Testing**: Test your plugin for common security issues, such as injection attacks, buffer overflows, or improper authentication mechanisms.
